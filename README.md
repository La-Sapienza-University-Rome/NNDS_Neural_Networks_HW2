# Homework #2 - NNDS Neural Networks for Data Science
This notebook contains the solution to the second homework of NNDS class in La Sapienza University of Rome. The topic of the assigment was Continual Learning.


## Overview: The homework is composed of four parts: 
1. selecting a dataset; 
2. implementing a custom component (ONLY if you did not submit the first homework or if you want to improve your mark); 
3. implementing a neural network and training it on the dataset; 
4. implementing an additional continual learning strategy on top of it (Elastic Weight Consolidation).
